PyOnyx
======

Python API for the onyx/* libraries provided with the imx508 toolchain for Onyx Boox devices (e.g. M92)

We are creating the SIP files for SIP 4.12.2. The source code is provided with the respective source tarball in the repository's root directory. The necessary Python 2.7.3 and PyQt 4.8.5 builds (fully compatible with the Qt version from the Onyx toolchain) are available from the onyx_pyqt.zip file.
